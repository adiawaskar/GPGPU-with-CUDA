## Aim of the project:
The aim of this project is to make perform General Purpose Computations on NVIDIA's GPU using CUDA API.



## Clone the repo:
```bash
https://github.com/adiawaskar/GPGPU-with-CUDA.git
```



## Programming language used:
* C++



## Results:

GPU gives much faster and more efficient results as compared to CPU due to the larger number of cores in it. Its ability to tackle large amounts of parallelism helps us overcome the limitations that we face on the CPU. Following is a graphical representation and example of how GPU is better than CPU:
